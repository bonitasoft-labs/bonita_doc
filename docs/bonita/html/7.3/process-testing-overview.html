<h1>Process testing overview</h1>
<p>Bonita BPM Studio contains several features that you can use to verify your process while it is in development.</p>
<p>You can validate a process diagram: choose <strong><em>Validate</em></strong> from the <strong><em>Diagram</em></strong> menu,
or go to the <strong>Details</strong> panel, <strong>Validation status</strong> tab and click <strong>Refresh</strong>. The <strong>Details</strong> panel contains a list
of warnings and errors indicating things to correct in the diagram. Click on a row in the list to highlight the relevant item in the diagram.</p>
<p>You can test some process components individually:</p>
<ul>
<li>Connectors: go to <strong><em>Test connector...</em></strong> in the <strong><em>Development</em></strong> menu.</li>
<li>Expressions: use the <strong><em>Evaluate</em></strong> feature of the Expression editor.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can run the process in debug mode, with the option to skip connector execution: click <strong><em>Debug</em></strong> in the Cool bar.</p>
<p>You can run the process locally, launching it from Bonita BPM Studio without first deploying it to Bonita BPM Portal.
You must <a href="?page=configure-a-test-organization" ng-click="contentCtrl.goTo($event, 'configure-a-test-organization')">create a test organization</a>
and <a href="?page=configuring-a-process" ng-click="contentCtrl.goTo($event, 'configuring-a-process')">configure a process</a> before you can
<a href="?page=run-a-process-from-bonita-bpm-studio-for-testing" ng-click="contentCtrl.goTo($event, 'run-a-process-from-bonita-bpm-studio-for-testing')">run a process from Bonita BPM Studio</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to functional testing during development, we recommend that you monitor the system load. This will help evaluate the performance, so you can make your process efficient.</p>
<p>When you have finished developing your process, we recommend that you perform a load test with the expected number of simultaneous users of the process, and a realistic rate of use of the process.
This will help you evaluate the size of platform (CPU, RAM, etc.) that you will need when the process goes into production.</p>
