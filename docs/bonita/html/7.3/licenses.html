<p>Bonita BPM 7.1 introduces a case-counter mechanism to align with the Bonita BPM Subscription edition licensing model. This page explains how to manage the license for your Bonita BPM Platform.</p>
<p>The <strong><em>License</em></strong> menu in Bonita BPM Portal displays information about the current license. This information is available to the platform administrator only.</p>
<p>The <a href="?page=bonita-bpm-studio-installation" ng-click="contentCtrl.goTo($event, 'bonita-bpm-studio-installation')">license for Bonita BPM Studio</a> is managed through a wizard when you start the studio for the first time after installation (or after the previous license expires).</p>
<h2>Case-counter licensing</h2>
<p>A case-counter license defines the maximum number of cases (process instances) that the platform is permitted to start in the counter period.<br>
The counter period is typically one year and starts when your Subscription starts or on the anniversary.<br>
Each time a case starts, the case counter is increased by one.<br>
Case-counter licenses are available for development and for production. A development license must not be used for production, and typically has a lower case limit than a production license.<br>
The maximum number of cases is defined in your commercial contract, in discussion with your sales person.</p>
<p>You can monitor the case counter using Bonita BPM Portal <em>License</em> page in the Administrator profile, or using the <a href="?hash=license&amp;page=platform-api" ng-click="contentCtrl.goTo($event, 'platform-api', 'license')">REST API</a> to create a custom monitoring / alerting tool.<br>
Those two means also allow you to check the expiration date of the license.</p>
<p>When the case counter reaches the limit set in the license, no more cases can be started. Active cases continue to completion.<br>
If a user tries to submit an instantiation form after the case counter maximum limit is reached, the form is not submitted and an error message is displayed.<br>
<strong>Note:</strong> If the process still uses legacy, 6.x, forms, there is no error message.</p>
<h2>Get a new license</h2>
<p>Your contract with Bonitasoft specifies the details of the subscription you have purchased, including the edition, and case limit for case-counter licensing. A license matching the subscription details is generated on request.</p>
<p>If this is a license renewal, you can find your request key in the Bonita BPM Portal <em>License</em> menu of the Administrator profile or using the <a href="?hash=license&amp;page=platform-api" ng-click="contentCtrl.goTo($event, 'platform-api', 'license')">platform REST API</a>.<br>
A request key looks like this: <code>(CIVpYDRB8bhouXdWadLY1M9TVctwYUYuv7ou7sqeIrSUSuCqUIkjQAs0ZGgzbtqv3gguFOHlyMZkyvwdr4HLgg==)</code>.</p>
<p>If this is the first time you generate a license, you need to generate a request key.</p>
<h3>Generate the request key</h3>
<p>On the server where you installed Bonita BPM Platform:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to the <code>request_key_utils</code> folder</li>
<li>Run the <code>generateRequestKey.bat</code> script (for Windows) or the <code>generateRequestKey.sh</code> script (for other operating systems)</li>
</ol>
<h3>Generate the new license</h3>
<p>Copy your request key and go to the <a href="https://customer.bonitasoft.com/license/request">Customer Portal license request</a> page.<br>
Then fill in the details in the form, copy the request key in the <em>Request Key</em> field, and submit.<br>
Note: keep the brackets () in the key; if the key is separated by a line break, remove it and put the key on a single line.</p>
<p>The license file will be sent to you by email.</p>
<h2>Install the license</h2>
<p>When you receive the license file (<code>.lic</code> file extension):</p>
<ul>
<li>If this is the first time you start the bundle, copy the file to the<code>&lt;TOMCAT_HOME&gt;/setup/platform_conf/licenses</code> folder or <code>&lt;JBOSS_HOME&gt;/setup/platform_conf/licenses/</code> folder before starting the bundle.</li>
<li>If the bundle has already been started, <a href="?hash=update_platform_conf&amp;page=BonitaBPM_platform_setup" ng-click="contentCtrl.goTo($event, 'BonitaBPM_platform_setup', 'update_platform_conf')">you need to use the Platform setup tool</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>License renewal scheduling</h2>
<p>If you are still within the Subscription period when you approach the license expiration date, request a new license that starts on the last day of your current license.<br>
Put the license you receive in the license folder alongside the existing license.<br>
When you reach the &quot;changeover&quot; date for the licenses, Bonita BPM Engine switches automatically from the expired license to the valid one.
<strong>Note:</strong> We recommend to regularly remove license files of expired licenses from the server.</p>
<p>If you approach both the license expiration date and the end of the Subscription period, contact your sales person.</p>
<p>The case counter is reset at the end of the counter period.<br>
If your license expiration date comes before the end of the counter period, get and install a new license as usual. The case counter will continue from its current value under the new license.<br>
If you approach or reach the case counter limit before the end of the license period, contact your sales person to get a new license with additional cases.</p>
