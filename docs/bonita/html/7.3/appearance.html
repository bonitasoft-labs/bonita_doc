<h1>Appearance</h1>
<p>Page and form appearance is based on the Bootstrap v3.3.2 CSS framework. To define the appearance of a page or form you can use an application <a href="?page=themes" ng-click="contentCtrl.goTo($event, 'themes')">theme resource</a>, apply a Boostrap theme, or manually add a custom CSS class that you implement.</p>
<h2>Apply an application resource theme</h2>
<p>By default, pages designed with the UI Designer are deployed in an <a href="?page=applications" ng-click="contentCtrl.goTo($event, 'applications')">application</a> and use the theme chosen for the application.</p>
<h2>Apply a Boostrap CSS theme</h2>
<p>Many Bootstrap CSS themes are available (for example at <a href="https://bootswatch.com/">https://bootswatch.com/</a>).</p>
<p>To apply a Bootstrap theme, download it and add it to your page or form as a <a href="?page=assets" ng-click="contentCtrl.goTo($event, 'assets')">CSS asset</a>. To see the result, preview your page. Applying a Bootstrap theme as a CSS asset will override the application theme.</p>
<h2>Customize appearance</h2>
<p>The appearance of a page or form widget can be modified with a CSS stylesheet.</p>
<p>The UI Designer use the Bootstrap CSS, so the markup provided for widgets uses <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/css/#helper-classes">Bootstrap CSS classes</a>. You can add classes by using the <em>CSS classes</em> property field available for each widget in the whiteboard.</p>
<p>Then, to customize the widget appearance, include a <a href="?page=assets" ng-click="contentCtrl.goTo($event, 'assets')">CSS asset</a> in your page or form. In this CSS file you can either overwrite the Bootstrap CSS classes or implement the classes you specify in the <em>CSS classes</em> property field.</p>
