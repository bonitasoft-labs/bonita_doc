<h1>Community to Subscription upgrade</h1>
<p>Upgrading means moving from a Bonita BPM Community edition environment to any Bonita BPM Subscription
edition environment.</p>
<p><strong>Warnings:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>An upgrade can only be performed on a single Bonita BPM versions. You cannot migrate to a new version at the same time as you update edition.</li>
<li>After it is applied, an upgrade cannot be undone.</li>
</ul>
<p>An upgrade is performed in two phases.</p>
<h2>Bonita BPM Studio upgrade</h2>
<p>To upgrade a Community edition Bonita BPM Studio and its resources (such as process diagrams, data models), follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="?page=bonita-bpm-studio-installation" ng-click="contentCtrl.goTo($event, 'bonita-bpm-studio-installation')">Install a Bonita BPM Studio</a> Subscription edition.</li>
<li>Export your resources from the Bonita BPM Studio Community edition to <code>.bos</code> files. We recommend that you keep these resource files as a backup.</li>
<li>Import your resource files into the Bonita BPM Studio in Subscription edition.</li>
</ol>
<p>The upgrade is performed automatically and silently when importing resources into Bonita BPM Studio Subscription edition.</p>
<p>Remember that an upgrade is a non-reversible operation:
after your resources are imported in the Subscription edition, you will not be able to export from the Subscription edition Studio and then import them back into the Community edition.</p>
<h2>Bonita BPM platform upgrade</h2>
<p>Upgrading a Bonita BPM platform allows you to keep the platform data (process definitions, cases, BDM...)
while benefiting from the Subscription edition features.</p>
<p>The upgrade procedure is quite simple and only requires a limited service downtime (less than an hour for basic configurations).</p>
<div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
<p>A Bonita BPM platform upgrade can only be performed on the same database type.</p>
</div>
<p>To upgrade a Bonita BPM platform from Community edition to a Subscription edition, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="?page=back-up-bonita-bpm-platform" ng-click="contentCtrl.goTo($event, 'back-up-bonita-bpm-platform')">Backup your Bonita BPM platform and databases</a>.</li>
<li>Make sure that the platform is shut down.</li>
<li>Download the <a href="?page=deploy-bundle" ng-click="contentCtrl.goTo($event, 'deploy-bundle')">Deploy bundle</a>.</li>
<li>Update the configuration using the Platform setup tool included:
<ol>
<li>Configure the <a href="?hash=configure_tool&amp;page=BonitaBPM_platform_setup" ng-click="contentCtrl.goTo($event, 'BonitaBPM_platform_setup', 'configure_tool')">Platform setup tool</a> to use your database.</li>
<li>Copy the content of <code>platform_conf/initial</code> in a directory named e.g. <code>sp_conf</code>.</li>
<li>Run <code>setup.sh pull</code> or <code>setup.bat pull</code> to get your current configuration in <code>platform_conf/current</code>.</li>
<li>Reapply the customizations made in the current configuration to the configuration in the <code>sp_conf</code>.</li>
<li>Delete the content of the folder <code>platform_conf/current</code>.</li>
<li>Put the content of the folder <code>sp_conf</code> in <code>platform_conf/current</code>.</li>
<li>Set the edition in the <code>sp_conf</code> configuration folder, see <a href="?hash=edition_specification&amp;page=tomcat-bundle" ng-click="contentCtrl.goTo($event, 'tomcat-bundle', 'edition_specification')">here</a>.</li>
<li><a href="?page=licenses" ng-click="contentCtrl.goTo($event, 'licenses')">Put your license</a> in <code>platform_conf/licenses</code>.</li>
<li>Run <code>setup.sh push</code> or <code>setup.bat push</code> to push this configuration in database.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Replace the community bonita.war with the subscription version of bonita.war. You can find it in the Deploy bundle.
<ul>
<li>on Tomcat simply delete the <code>webapps/bonita.war</code> file and the <code>webapps/bonita</code> folder and copy the new war here.</li>
<li>on JBoss delete <code>standalone/deployments/bonita-all-in-one-&lt;VERSION&gt;.ear</code> and the file having the same name with <code>.deployed</code>, then copy the new ear in the same place.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Start you platform again.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Upgrade is now finished, you can verify that you are now running a subscription edition in the portal user interface, the dialog displayed from the top right &quot;Settings / About&quot; menu should indicates the correct Subscription edition.</p>
