<h1>Building Bonita BPM</h1>
<p>In order to build Bonita BPM you need to use the script provided in <a href="https://github.com/Bonitasoft-Community/Build-Bonita-BPM">Build Bonita BPM</a> GitHub project. Use the branch of the project that match the version you want to build.</p>
<p>Simply run <code>bash build-script-7.3.2.sh</code> and provide required information.</p>
<p>A script is used because some components rely on components that are built earlier in the sequence, so the build order must be respected.</p>
