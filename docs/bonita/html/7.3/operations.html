<h1>Operations</h1>
<p>An operation is an action that updates the value of a variable (using an expression) when a task is performed.<br>
You can specify any number of operations on a task. Operations are executed in the order they are listed.</p>
<h2>Define operations at task level</h2>
<p>An operation at task level updates the value of a variable defined for the task or at process level. You can also use an operation at a task to update the value of a search index.</p>
<p>To define an operation at task level:</p>
<ol>
<li>Select the relevant task and go to the <strong>Details</strong> panel, <strong>General</strong> tab, <strong>Operations</strong> pane.</li>
<li>Click <strong><em>Add</em></strong> to add an operation.</li>
<li>From the drop-down list, choose the variable to be updated.</li>
<li>Launch the Expression Editor, by clicking the crayon icon.</li>
<li>Using the Expression Editor, enter the expression to define the new value of the variable.
If you define the expression with a script, you can use the current value of the variable being updated in the script, so, for example, you can increment a counter. Make sure that the return type matches the type of the variable being updated.</li>
</ol>
<p>You can define a sequence of operations at a task. The operations are performed in the order in which they are listed, at the end of the task. You cannot re-order operations after they are defined, so you need to define the operations in the order they are to be performed.</p>
<h2>Operation types</h2>
<h3>Business object (BO)</h3>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>takes value of</strong></em> : the value of the right operand variable is used to update the value of the left operand (the BO) using the &quot;=&quot; operator</li>
<li><em><strong>Java method</strong></em>: the left BO is updated with the value from the right operand using an invoked Java method</li>
<li><em><strong>instantiate with</strong></em>: at runtime, when the operator is called, the business data variable points to the selected BO instance if it uses a <em>Query expression type</em>.<br>
The BO instance must exist in the business data database; otherwise the operator throws an exception.<br>
The BO instance is not modified during the operation but from that point onward, any expression or operation in the process can reference this object instance to make changes.<br>
If it uses a <em>Script expression type</em>, you can use the contract inputs to fill in the BO attributes.<br>
Go to <a href="?page=define-and-deploy-the-bdm" ng-click="contentCtrl.goTo($event, 'define-and-deploy-the-bdm')">Initialize BDM attributes from contract inputs in task operations</a> for more information.</li>
<li><em><strong>isDeleted</strong></em>: an operator 'Is Deleted' can be called on a business data variable. The BO instance that the business data references is deleted from the database, at runtime, after the task is completed.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Warning:</strong> Calling other operations (including <em><strong>instantiate with</strong></em>) after calling <em><strong>isDeleted</strong></em> on the same Business Object, in the same task, is not supported. If you want to re instantiate your Business Object, and perform operations on it, you should do it in a separate task.</p>
<p><strong>Warning:</strong> Operations on business objects can be done only at task level.</p>
<h3>Simple data and List of options</h3>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>takes value of</strong></em>: the value of the right operand variable is used to update the value of the left operand using the &quot;=&quot; operator</li>
</ul>
<h3>Java Object</h3>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>takes value of</strong></em>: the value of the right operand variable is used to update the value of the left operand using the &quot;=&quot; operator</li>
<li><em><strong>Java method</strong></em>: the left object is updated with the value from the right operand using an invoked Java method</li>
</ul>
<h3>XML Object</h3>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>takes value of</strong></em>: the value of the right operand variable is used to update the value of the left operand using the &quot;=&quot; operator</li>
<li><em>**XPath update **</em>: the left object is updated with the value from the right operand using an XPath expression</li>
</ul>
<h3>Document</h3>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>set document</strong></em>: the value of the right operand document is used to create a new version of the document</li>
</ul>
