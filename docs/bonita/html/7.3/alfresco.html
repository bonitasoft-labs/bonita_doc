<h1>Alfresco</h1>
<p>Bonita BPM Studio contains connectors for Alfresco 3.4 and Alfresco 4.2. For each version, there are the following connectors:</p>
<ul>
<li>Delete an item by ID (folder, file, etc)</li>
<li>Delete folder by path (delete a folder and its contents)</li>
<li>Create a folder by path</li>
<li>Upload a file to a destination folder</li>
</ul>
<p>Notes for using these connectors:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Warning:</strong>
There is a conflict between libraries provided with the Alfresco connector and libraries provided by other connectors or the platform itself if you use a data of type Object.<br>
When you configure a process that uses the Alfresco connector, you must <a href="?page=manage-jar-files" ng-click="contentCtrl.goTo($event, 'manage-jar-files')">manage the jar files</a>.</li>
<li>To delete a folder, it must be empty.</li>
<li>In the path, all parameters have to be <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_urlencode.asp">URL Encoded</a>. Spaces are not allowed. For example: <code>/User Homes/user</code> has to be written <code>/User%20Homes/user</code>.</li>
</ul>
