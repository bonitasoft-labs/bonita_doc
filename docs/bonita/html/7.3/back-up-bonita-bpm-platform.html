<h1>Back up Bonita BPM Platform</h1>
<p>Any basic one node (non-clustered) installation can be backed up to be restored later.
In a <a href="?page=overview-of-bonita-bpm-in-a-cluster" ng-click="contentCtrl.goTo($event, 'overview-of-bonita-bpm-in-a-cluster')">Bonita BPM cluster</a>, you need to back up the nodes, the shared database.</p>
<p>A cold backup (total shutdown) is recommended, to avoid losing data being processed during the backup process. Note: make sure your database server is backed up.
(Please refer to the specific documentation for your database concerning the backup procedure).</p>
<ol>
<li>Stop the application server</li>
<li>Save the Application Server configuration files modified during Bonita setup.</li>
<li>Save the deployed web application (i.e. <code>bonita.war</code>) (for Tomcat <code>[TOMCAT_HOME]/webapps/bonita.war</code>), or you can redeploy all applications at startup.
If you decide not to save the <code>webapps</code> directory, make sure that you have a copy of your Bonita application available.</li>
<li>Back up your database (Please refer to the specific documentation for your database concerning the backup procedure).</li>
<li>Start the application server.</li>
</ol>
