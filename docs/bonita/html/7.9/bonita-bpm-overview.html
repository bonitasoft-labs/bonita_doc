<h1>Bonita platform overview</h1>
<p>Build engaging, personalized, process-based business applications using BPM application platform. Adapt to business changes real-time</p>
<p>Bonita has two parts: the development environment, Bonita Studio, and the runtime environment, Bonita Platform.</p>
<h2>Bonita Studio</h2>
<p>Bonita Studio is a graphical environment for creating processes, applications, data models, and users views (pages and forms). It contains three major design tools:</p>
<ul>
<li>the whiteboard, for drawing a process flow diagram and defining the detail of steps, transitions, decision points and other process elements</li>
<li>the Development menu, to extend the Studio capabilities and create your data models</li>
<li>the UI Designer, which is used to create application pages and process forms</li>
</ul>
<p>Bonita Studio is the development tool for the Business Analyst and Application Developer. Back-end java developers work in Bonita Studio and collaborate with front-end developers working in the UI Designer.</p>
<p>You can <a href="?page=bonita-bpm-installation-overview" ng-click="contentCtrl.goTo($event, 'bonita-bpm-installation-overview')">install Bonita Studio</a> on your computer, then create and test processes, create data models, applications and application views (pages and forms).</p>
<p>Bonita Studio contains a <strong>Bonita Platform</strong> (Tomcat, UI Designer, Bonita Portal, Bonita Engine, and an h2 database), suitable for testing an application that is in development. When you run a process, it is automatically deployed onto the development platform.</p>
<p>Process forms, used to complete the human tasks, are created in the UI Designer, and use the data models created in the Studio.</p>
<p>Users can use Bonita Portal (<em>User</em> profile) to view and complete the process tasks for all processes. You can also build personalized process-based applications. To do so, use the UI Designer to create application pages that display business data from the data models, link the pages to processes thanks to action buttons, then use the Bonita Portal application builder to construct the application piece by piece.</p>
<a id="platform"/>
<h2>Bonita Platform</h2>
<p><a href="?page=engine-architecture-overview" ng-click="contentCtrl.goTo($event, 'engine-architecture-overview')">Bonita Engine</a> is the execution engine of Bonita.</p>
<p>As mentioned before, <a href="?page=bonita-bpm-portal-interface-overview" ng-click="contentCtrl.goTo($event, 'bonita-bpm-portal-interface-overview')">Bonita Portal</a> is the part of Bonita that is visible to process users, who use it to view tasks and take actions thanks to a generic task list for all processes they are involved in.</p>
<p>But Bonita Portal is also the tool used by the tenant administrator to <a href="?page=processes" ng-click="contentCtrl.goTo($event, 'processes')">install, deploy and manage processes</a> and to <a href="?page=applications" ng-click="contentCtrl.goTo($event, 'applications')">build applications</a>. We use the word &quot;tenant&quot; here, in case the platform would be made of <a href="?page=multi-tenancy-and-tenant-configuration" ng-click="contentCtrl.goTo($event, 'multi-tenancy-and-tenant-configuration')">several tenants</a>.</p>
<p>To install Bonita Engine and Bonita Portal in a qualification or production environment, <a href="?hash=platform&amp;page=bonita-bpm-installation-overview" ng-click="contentCtrl.goTo($event, 'bonita-bpm-installation-overview', 'platform')">install Bonita Platform</a>.</p>
<p>In Bonita Studio, once a process is ready, you can <a href="?page=build-a-process-for-deployment" ng-click="contentCtrl.goTo($event, 'build-a-process-for-deployment')">build</a> it and deploy it on your Bonita qualification or production platform.</p>
<h2>Editions</h2>
<p>Bonita is provided in five different editions: Community, Teamwork, Efficiency, Performance and Enterprise.</p>
<h2>Getting started</h2>
<p><strong>I'm currently using Bonita 6.x. Will 7.x be a big change?</strong></p>
<p>Bonita 7.x provides new and improved features, including the <a href="?page=ui-designer-overview" ng-click="contentCtrl.goTo($event, 'ui-designer-overview')">UI Designer</a> for creating application pages and forms, as well as <a href="?page=contracts-and-contexts" ng-click="contentCtrl.goTo($event, 'contracts-and-contexts')">contracts and context</a> to create a clear split between the process logic, the data, and the user views.</p>
<div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
<p>You will also find lots of familiar features, which continue to work as they did in 6.x.</p>
<p><strong>Tell me about the documentation.</strong></p>
<p>We're continually updating the documentation.<br>
