<p>Before you put reporting in place, you need to create a dedicated reporting database.
For performance reasons, it is a best practice to isolate reporting data from live data.</p>
<p>This installation is performed manually outside of Bonita.
This documentation does not detail the installation procedure of such a database but provides some best practices.</p>
<h2>Best practice</h2>
<p>Start by identifying the KPIs you wish to track, then create the reporting database structure.
You need to create the appropriate tables and columns to store the reporting data.</p>
<p>When creating your reporting database, follow these best practices to ensure quick read/write operations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Avoid relational structures, in order to reduce the number of joins when querying data. Prefer flat table structures, because data duplication is generally not a concern.</li>
<li>Do not use transactions as these can slow down read/write operations.</li>
<li>Only perform select/insert operations and no update/delete.</li>
</ul>
