<h2>Terminology</h2>
<p>Reporting is the act of collecting and aggregating Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to present them in reports.<br>
KPIs are defined as a set of measures that are used to assess the operational success of a business process.</p>
<p>Reporting is also know as Business Intelligence (BI) or Business Activity Monitoring (BAM).</p>
<h2>Reporting dependencies</h2>
<p>Reporting involves Bonita and two other third-party software components:</p>
<ul>
<li>A reporting database of your choice.</li>
<li>A BI tool of your choice.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Reporting main steps</h2>
<p>Reporting is composed in several ordered steps.</p>
<p>At design time:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="?page=set-up-a-reporting-database" ng-click="contentCtrl.goTo($event, 'set-up-a-reporting-database')">Reporting database setup</a></li>
<li><a href="?page=set-up-kpis" ng-click="contentCtrl.goTo($event, 'set-up-kpis')">KPI definition in Bonita Studio</a></li>
<li><a href="?page=create-a-report" ng-click="contentCtrl.goTo($event, 'create-a-report')">Report creation in the BI tool</a></li>
</ol>
<p>At execution time:</p>
<ol>
<li>KPI collection in Bonita Engine and storage in the reporting database (this is performed automatically based on KPI definitions)</li>
<li>Report generation using the BI tool or Bonita Portal</li>
</ol>
