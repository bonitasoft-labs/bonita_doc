<h1>Preload the forms cache</h1>
<p>The forms cache allow legacy forms (6.x) to be displayed more rapidly. It is possible to preload this cache.</p>
<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This information applies to legacy forms developed with Bonita 6.x, or with the <em>6.x Application</em> backward-compatibility features of Bonita 7.0. It is not necessary to preload forms developed with the UI Designer.</p>
</div>
<p>The first time a form is displayed, it is cached so that when it is displayed again it loads more quickly. This is the default behavior. However, you can speed up the first display of a form by preloading it into the forms cache.</p>
<p>To preload the forms cache, use the formsCache service, which is accessed over HTTP.</p>

<h2>Preload the forms cache</h2>
<p>First, send a GET request to retrieve the list of forms in a specified process. Then send a PUT request for each form to load it into the cache. The PUT request can sometimes take several seconds to respond, depending on the complexity of the form.</p>
<p>If you are using the Enterprise, Performance or Efficiency edition, you can create a custom page to preload the forms cache. For the Teamwork or Community edition, you need to create an application.</p>
<h2>Forms cache configuration</h2>
<p>The forms cache is implemented using EhCache. The cache configuration is defined in <code>$BONITA_HOME/client/platform/conf/cache-config.xml</code>.
By default, when you restart the server, the cache is emptied, so forms would have to be loaded again. To keep the cached forms after a restart, set the <code>diskPersistent</code> property to <code>true</code>.</p>
