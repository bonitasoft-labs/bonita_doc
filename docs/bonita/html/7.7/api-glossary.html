<h1>Bonita REST API glossary</h1>
<p>List of Bonita REST API definitions and descriptions.</p>
<h2>Definition</h2>
<p><strong>Definition</strong>: in Bonita Studio you create definition of processes. A definition of a process includes name, version, definition of actors name...<br>
A process definition includes definition of tasks.<br>
The definition of tasks includes connectors, contract inputs declaration (for user task)...</p>
<p><strong>Instance</strong> : when you start a process (using Portal or API) what actually happen is a creation of a new process instance based on the selected process definition.<br>
Starting a process instance will actually start a new instance of the start event and usually start a new instance of the first task.</p>
<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
<p><strong>Note</strong>: if a process loops on a task, multiple instances of a same task definition will be created.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Case</strong>: A case is a process instance.</p>
<h2>ProcessInstance (REST: case)</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>id</strong>: id of the process instance</li>
<li><strong>callerId (not in REST)</strong>: id of the call activity use to create this process instance. <code>null/0</code> if process instance was not created using a call activity.</li>
<li><strong>processDefinitionId</strong>: the id of process definition use to create this process instance.</li>
<li><strong>rootProcessInstanceId (rootCaseId for REST)</strong>: the id of the top parent process instance. Parents exist for event sub-processes and when instance was created using a call activity. If there is no parent it is his own id.</li>
<li><strong>endDate</strong>: the date on which the process instance is marked as <em>completed</em>.<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
<p><strong>Note</strong>: the <em>completed</em> state is a transitionnary state. Right after a process instance is <em>completed</em>, it is archived.</p>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>FlowNodeInstance (REST: flowNode)</h2>
<p>Use to represent an instance of a none start event, user task, call activity, multi instance activity (the container instance and also included instances), gateways...</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>id</strong>: id of the FlowNodeInstance</li>
<li><strong>displayDescription</strong>: dynamically generated human readable flow node description. Only apply to <code>UserTaskInstance</code>, empty in REST API and null in Engine API otherwise.</li>
<li><strong>displayName</strong>: same as for <code>displayDescription</code> but for the name. Only apply to <code>UserTaskInstance</code>, empty in REST API and null in Engine API otherwise.</li>
<li><strong>executedBy</strong>: the id (long) of the user who performed this flow node. If performed by a substitute id is set to 0 and the performer id is stored in <code>executedBySubstitute</code>.</li>
<li><strong>executedBySubstitute</strong>: the id (long) of the user who performed this flow node in case where a substitute did it. If flow node was not performed by a substitute the value is set to 0 and the performer is stored in <code>executedBy</code>. It applies only to flow nodes that are user tasks</li>
<li><strong>flownodeDefinitionId (not in REST)</strong>: the id of the flow node definition who lead to this flow node instance creation. In the case of a multi-activity task instance, each instance points to the original flow node multi instance definition.</li>
<li><strong>parentContainerId (parentCaseId for REST)</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Id is not always an id of a process instance:
<ul>
<li>For <code>UserTask</code> or <code>ManualTaskInstance</code> (i.e. subtask in portal), <code>AutomaticTaskInstance</code> (BPMN service task), <code>BoundaryEventInstance</code>, <code>CallActivityInstance</code>: id of the process instance that include directly the instance of the element. Behavior is the same in case of a process instance created by a call activity: id returned is the id of the child process that includes the flow node.</li>
<li>For a flow node that is created by a mutli-instantiated task definition: parent flow node instance id.</li>
<li>For <code>BoundaryEventInstance</code>: id of the parent of the attached task instance</li>
<li>For tasks in event sub process: event sub process id</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>parentProcessInstanceId (parentCaseId for REST)</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Always returns the immediate containing process instance ID. Don't escalate to parent process.</li>
<li>For event sub-process: id of the process instance that initiate the sub-process event.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>processDefinitionId (processId for REST)</strong>: Returns the ID of the process definition where this <code>FlowNodeInstance</code> is defined</li>
<li><strong>rootContainerId (rootCaseId for REST)</strong>: Always return the top (root) process instance id. Compare to <code>parentContainerId</code> escalate to the root process instance when called on a <code>FlowNodeInstance</code> that is part of a process instance created by a call activity execution.</li>
<li><strong>parentTaskId for REST</strong>: Only apply to sub task (task dynamically added by user at runtime). Represent the id of the task from which the subtask was created.</li>
</ul>
