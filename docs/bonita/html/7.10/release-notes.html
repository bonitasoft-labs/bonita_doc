<h1>Release notes</h1>
<h2>New values added</h2>
<a id="acm"/>
<h3>Adaptive Case Management with Bonita</h3>
<p>It is now possible to create Living applications based on a mix of structured and unstructured processes. Users have more decision power on what to execute next, and can create their own task to adapt to a case specificities.

<a id="monitoring"/>
<h3>Monitoring</h3>
<p>Bonita 7.10 now includes a brand new extensible <a href="bonita/7.10/runtime-monitoring" ng-click="contentCtrl.goTo($event, 'runtime-monitoring')">monitoring</a> mechanism, in the form of a series of technical and Bonita-related metrics made available. Monitoring is crutial to ensure that Bonita runtime environment is correctly sized and tuned and  that it runs healthy.</p>
<a id="guest-user"/>
<h3>Guest User (Teamwork, Efficiency, Performance, and Enterprise editions only)</h3>
<p>Opening the content of a living application to public access is now possible thanks to the new <a href="bonita/7.10/guest-user" ng-click="contentCtrl.goTo($event, 'guest-user')">&quot;Guest User&quot;</a> feature. Used in process actor mappings, added to a custom profile to access applications, it allows anyone to access some public content.<br>
The Bonita application layout has been updated accordingly, to allow a Bonita user with credentials to log in from a public application and access password-protected content, if any.</p>
<a id="deploy-project"/>
<h3>Project deployment in Bonita Studio</h3>
<p>The new <em>Deploy...</em> action in Bonita Studio allows you to <a href="bonita/7.10/project_deploy_in_dev_suite" ng-click="contentCtrl.goTo($event, 'project_deploy_in_dev_suite')">deploy a whole project</a> (or a subset) in the embedded runtime environment, taking care of deploying all artifacts on the right order. Import a .bos file, clone a Git repository, or right click on the project name, click on <em>Deploy...</em> and save a lot of time.</p>
<a id="bdm-multi-package"/>
<h3>Business Data Model handles multiple packages</h3>
<p>Bonita 7.10 now allows to create different packages to store Business Objects.<br>
In the Development phase, it is also possible to import a BDM into the existing one, as long as Business Objects names are unique accross packages, so several teams can work on different packages and get their BDM integrated at some point, before deployment.<br>
Learn more <a href="bonita/7.10/define-and-deploy-the-bdm" ng-click="contentCtrl.goTo($event, 'define-and-deploy-the-bdm')">here</a>.</p>
<h3>A Bonita User Application example available</h3>
<p>Create your own Living Application from a handy starting point with the new Bonita User Application. It contains the User Portal Tasklist, a new Case list developed in the UI Designer (i.e. customizable), and the User Portal Process list.<br>
It is made available from Studio Welcome page, in the <em>Resources</em> tile.</p>
<h3>Archived contract data (Enterprise and Performance editions)</h3>
<p>Bonita 7.10 now allows to disable the archiving of Contract Data, to improve the platform performance. More details as to how <a href="bonita/7.10/configurable-archive" ng-click="contentCtrl.goTo($event, 'configurable-archive')">here</a>.</p>
<h3>Dynamic tabs in tab container</h3>
<p>In the Tabs Container, you can now hide/show and enable/disable a tab given some conditions, customize a tab title and add CSS dynamically, or change tabs format to pills and build nice side menus thanks to vertical display.</p>
<h3>Docker</h3>
<p>A Bonita docker distribution is now available for download and installation both in community and subscription editions.
See <a href="bonita/7.10/bonita-docker-installation" ng-click="contentCtrl.goTo($event, 'bonita-docker-installation')">how to install and use it</a>.</p>
<h2>Improvements</h2>
<h3>Better data management in the UI Designer</h3>
<p>From the page or form editors, you can now:</p>
<ul>
<li>View the content of the Business Data Model thanks to a new vertical tab &quot;Data Model&quot;</li>
<li>Create a business variable to display instances of Business Objects. This can be achieved by drag and drop from the object to the whiteboard.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Collaborative development of UI Designer artifacts</h3>
<p>The JavaScript code contained in variable and custom widgets used to be presented on only one line in the code, making the code review very difficult.
Extracting this code in external files makes it readable and makes working with Pull Requests an easy game when developing UI Designer artifacts.</p>
<h3>Studio Welcome page. New.</h3>
<p>A new, simplified design has been implemented for the studio Welcome page. It is now more project-oriented in the Subscription editions and it allows to directly import official Bonita project examples like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Procurement example</li>
<li>Expense report example</li>
<li>Credit Card dispute resolution, with the implementation of an Adaptive Case Management use-case. (Enterprise only)<br>
To easily learn about each new Bonita version highlights, you can now also find this Release notes page at first Studio launch, in a second tab right after the Welcome page. Once closed, you can retrieve it later from the studio (Menu <em>Help</em> &gt; <em>Open Release Notes</em>) option.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Table and Data table widgets</h3>
<p>You can add links, icons, and actions or customize styles with the new html support in the table cells.<br>
Additional properties have also been added to differentiate lines (zebra-striping), condensate table contents or even add borders to cells and table.</p>
<h3>Profile dropdown in application modal of the Bonita layout</h3>
<p>Labels for the default options were changed to be more intuitive. The profile dropdown was also disabled if the user has only one available profile.</p>
<h3>Support of invalid XML characters</h3>
<p>Some special characters are considered as invalid in XML <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/xml/#charsets">(more details)</a> .<br>
In Bonita 7.10, it is now possible to submit a contract containing some of those invalid characters.<br>
The following connectors have also been updated to be resilient to those characters:</p>
<ul>
<li>The connector <em>document templating</em> in version 1.1.3 removes all invalid XML characters from the resulting document.</li>
<li>The connector <em>web service</em> in version 1.2.5 removes all invalid XML characters from the envelope.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Studio Windows installer</h3>
<ul>
<li>Now detects if an anti-virus is enabled and if so, suggests to exclude the folder where Bonita is installed from the anti-virus scanning scope, to improve Studio performance.</li>
<li>Now detects if the fire-wall is enabled and if so, automatically allows incoming traffic for the studio and the embedded JVM (Community only) executables. It will avoid fire-wall security notifications at first startup.</li>
</ul>
<h3>MySql utf8mb4 support</h3>
<p>Previously, when using a Mysql database, the only supported encoding was utf8mb3, which was deprecated as of Mysql 8.
Bonita now supports the (default) utf8mb4 encoding, and it is now the recommended configuration.</p>
<h3>Email connector</h3>
<p>Connector definition has been updated to add a Return-Path input parameter.</p>
<h2>Change of edition</h2>
<h3>User Portal Task list</h3>
<p>This custom page, first one in the User Portal, is now made available in the Community edition. Create your own Living Application with a fully-functional task list.</p>
<h2>Technical updates</h2>
<h3>Renaming</h3>
<p>The Tomcat bundle packaging has changed. Previously called <em>Bonita{edition}-7.x.y-tomcat</em>, it has been renamed to <em>Bonita{edition}-7.x.y</em>.
The file structure underneath, the location of scripts and configuration files remain unchanged.</p>
<h3>Connectors</h3>
<ul>
<li>The connectors <em>document templating</em>  and <em>document converter</em> dependency on <a href="https://github.com/opensagres/xdocreport">xdocreport</a> has been updated from 1.0.5 to 2.0.2.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Feature deprecations and removals</h2>
<h3>Deprecations</h3>
<h4>Alfresco connectors</h4>
<p>Alfresco connectors has been deprecated in favors of <a href="bonita/7.10/cmis" ng-click="contentCtrl.goTo($event, 'cmis')">CMIS connectors</a>.</p>
<h4>Transactional Groovy script connector</h4>
<p>The transactional Groovy script connector is deprecated. Use the non-transactional Groovy script connector instead.</p>
<h3>Removals</h3>

<p>As announced in the previous release, the Wildfly bundle has been removed in the 7.10 release.</p>
<h4>EJB support</h4>
<p>As announced in the previous release, the support for EJB communication to Bonita Engine has been removed in the 7.10 release.</p>
<h4>font-awesome in applications's themes</h4>
<p>In versions 7.9.1-7.9.x the provided themes were embedding font-awesome. The library was removed in favor of adding the webfonts directly in the pages in order to avoid version conflicts. If you were using a provided theme and any font-awesome icon, either :</p>
<ul>
<li>create a custom theme out of the provided themes and add the font-awesome library to it (as explained in the <a href="bonita/7.10/../../7.9/themes" ng-click="contentCtrl.goTo($event, '../../7.9/themes')">documentation for version 7.9</a>)</li>
<li>add the font-awesome webfonts to your page</li>
