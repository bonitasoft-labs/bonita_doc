<h2>Packaging comparison</h2>
<p>In Bonita, two versions are available for download:</p>
<ol>
<li>the Bonita Subscription Pack edition version for the Enterprise, Performance, Efficiency, and Teamwork editions</li>
<li>and the Bonita Community edition version for the Community edition</li>
</ol>
<p>For each version, there are several packaging options.

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Contract</td>
<td>Not in 6.x</td>
<td>A contract defines a clear separation between the process and the forms, making it possible to update the process user interface on the live system. See <a href="bonita/7.10/contracts-and-contexts" ng-click="contentCtrl.goTo($event, 'contracts-and-contexts')">Contracts</a></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Live update</td>
<td>Not in 6.x</td>
<td>A live update is a change that is applied to a process or application on the live system, without needing to pause the platform or take a process out of service. See <a href="bonita/7.10/live-update" ng-click="contentCtrl.goTo($event, 'live-update')">Live update</a></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Form mapping</td>
<td>Not in 6.x</td>
<td>A form is mapped to process instantiation, to case overview, or to a task. Any form that respects the relevant contract can be used. This separation between the process and the forms makes it possible to to the live update feature</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Business data</td>
<td>A process or application can use business data managed by the Bonita Platform. (Subscription editions only)</td>
<td>Now available in all editions. See <a href="bonita/7.10/define-and-deploy-the-bdm" ng-click="contentCtrl.goTo($event, 'define-and-deploy-the-bdm')">BDM</a></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Actor mapping</td>
<td>Each actor in a process can be mapped to a Group, Role, Membership or User within an organization. The mapping can be refined using an actor filter.</td>
<td>No change. Anonymous users are not supported anymore. See <a href="bonita/7.10/actors" ng-click="contentCtrl.goTo($event, 'actors')">Actor mapping</a> and <a href="bonita/7.10/actor-filtering" ng-click="contentCtrl.goTo($event, 'actor-filtering')">Actor filtering</a></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Environments</td>
<td>An Environment is a set of configuration information for a particular process. It contains the following information:  actor mapping, actor filters, parameters, connector implementations, dependencies for processes and applications. By having these Environments set up in the Studio, the developer can export processes that are ready to be run for a specific target platform. At any point in time, there is only one active Environment in Studio</td>
<td>No change. See <a href="bonita/7.10/environments" ng-click="contentCtrl.goTo($event, 'environments')">Environments</a></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Parameters</td>
<td>A Parameter is configuration information that can be attached to a process. Parameters are configured for an Environment. Parameter values can be updated at runtime.</td>
<td>Now available in all editions. See <a href="bonita/7.10/parameters" ng-click="contentCtrl.goTo($event, 'parameters')">Parameters</a> and <a href="bonita/7.10/environments" ng-click="contentCtrl.goTo($event, 'environments')">Environments</a></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Workspace API</td>
<td>The Workspace API is provided to generate <code>.bar</code> files from the command line, ready for production. .bar files are for deployment only and cannot be read by the studio. .bos files are for Studio interchange only and cannot be deployed to production. Each file format is optimal in term of content and is optimized for the target use case</td>
<td>The Workspace API retains its 6.x capabilities. Moreover, it can export forms that are mapped to process instantiations or tasks, and pages that are mapped to a case overview. It cannot export application pages that are not elements of a process. For this reason the Workspace API has been deprecated in 7.7.0, and is replaced by the <em>LA builder</em> included in the tooling suite of <a href="https://documentation.bonitasoft.com/bcd/2.0/" target="_self"><em>Bonita Continuous Delivery</em> add-on</a>.

<td>UI Designer</td>

See <a href="bonita/7.10/live-update" ng-click="contentCtrl.goTo($event, 'live-update')">live update</a>. The 6.x forms were supported up to the 7.7.x, so you could continue to run 6.x processes and ease migration.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Process migration</td>
<td>N/A</td>
<td>A process created in Bonita 6.x could run in 7.x (up to 7.7.x) without any modification. Starting with Bonita 7.8, you must use contracts created from outside of the studio, or migrate the forms.

<td>Expression Editor</td>
<td>This expression editor enables a developer to define a constant, an expression, a comparison or a Groovy script. Very often, there is no need to resort to a Groovy script, a constant, a comparison or an expression being enough. A number of predefined expressions are provided.  Convenience Groovy functions are provided to help write scripts more quickly. These functions provide simple access to frequently used information, such as information on the current user and the process initiator. It is now very easy to retrieve the manager or the email of the current user or the process initiator</td>

<tr>
<td>Iteration</td>
<td>Iteration can be by loop or by multi-instantiation. Multi-instantiation no longer requires a specific Bonita connector nor implementation of a specific java class. You can use a variable of type Collection or specify the cardinality using an expression. The completion condition is a simple expression</td>
