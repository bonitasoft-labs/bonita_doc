<p>This page explains how to use a shared repository so that several people can collaborate on process design.</p>
<h2>Workspaces and repositories</h2>
<p>A workspace is a directory where Bonita Studio stores working files related to process design. When you install Bonita Studio, a workspace is created automatically.</p>
<p>A local repository is a directory within your workspace.<br>
You can use local repositories to organize your work efficiently, for example by separating processes that do not interact.</p>
<p>A team repository is a shared repository on a Subversion (SVN) server that is used by the team collaborating on developing a process.<br>
A shared repository has typical code management features: locks, synchronization, versioning.<br>
Your workspace contains your local copy of the shared repository, which is synchronized with the shared repository on the SVN server.<br>
Note that the values of the process configurations (such as parameters) will not be synchronized on the remote SVN, to allow each Studio to have its own configuration.</p>
<h3>Switch workspace</h3>
<p>The default workspace is <em>studio_install_directory</em>/workspace.</p>
<p>To use a different workspace:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to the <strong>Diagram</strong> menu and choose <strong>Switch workspace...</strong>.</li>
<li>A popup shows the path of the workspace you are currently using.</li>
<li>In the popup, specify the path of the workspace you want to use. If the new workspace does not exist, you are asked whether you want to create it.</li>
<li>Click <strong><em>OK</em></strong>.</li>
<li>The workspace switch is applied the next time Bonita Studio starts. Click <strong><em>OK</em></strong> in the popup to restart Studio, or <strong><em>Cancel</em></strong> to continue in your current session.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Create a local repository</h3>
<p>You can create a local repository in your local workspace.<br>
The repository is created in your current workspace.</p>
<p>To create a local repository:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to the <strong>Repository</strong> menu, choose <strong>Local</strong>, then choose <strong>Create new local repository</strong>.</li>
<li>Specify a name for the new repository.</li>
<li>Click <strong><em>OK</em></strong> .</li>
<li>A status window shows the progress of the repository being built.<br>
When the repository has been successfully created, a message shows you are working with the new local repository.</li>
<li>Click on <strong><em>OK</em></strong> to finish.</li>
</ol>
<p>A new local repository is created. A new directory with the same name as the repository is added to your local workspace folder.</p>
<p>In Bonita Studio, you can see the new repository name shown at the top left, in the title bar.</p>
<h3>Export/Import a repository</h3>
<p>You can export all the content from a repository for exchange or backup purposes:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click on <strong>Diagram</strong> &gt; <strong>Export...</strong></li>
<li>Click  on <strong>Select All</strong> to embed all the repository content into the BOS archive.</li>
<li>Choose a location on your local drive to store the archive and click on <strong>Finish</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The exported archive can then be shared with other Studio of the same or newer version.</p>
<p>To import a BOS archive:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click on <strong>Diagram</strong> &gt; <strong>Import</strong> &gt;  <strong>BOS Archive...</strong></li>
<li>Choose the location of the archive on your local drive</li>
<li>In Subscription, you can choose the target repository of the imported content</li>
<li>Handle conflicting files if any</li>
<li>Click on <strong>Import</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>You can retrieve the whole content of a Studio workspace by exporting all its repositories and importing them into another Studio.</p>
<h2>Use a shared repository</h2>
<p>A shared repository is a repository on an SVN server. It can be accessed by members of the team working on a process definition.<br>
It is protected by username and password. Only directories in the SVN 'trunk' can be used as Bonita repositories.<br>
The repository created remotely is then copied to your default local workspace and synchronized.</p>
<p>A shared Bonita development repository contains the artifacts developed in Bonita Studio and the UI Designer. For the UI Designer artifacts, there is no locking, merging, or conflict management.</p>
<p><strong>Caution:</strong> Items defined in Bonita Portal are not stored in the shared repository.<br>
This includes applications and custom profiles. To share these artifacts, export them into an external repository such as Git.</p>
<h3>Prerequisites</h3>
<ul>
<li>A central SVN server accessible by the process designers, accessible by URL, and protected by login and password.</li>
<li>The same version of Bonita must be used by all users of the shared repository.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Create a shared repository</h3>
<p>There are two stages to creating a repository: connect to the SVN server, then specify the name of the new repository. Follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>In the <strong>Repository</strong> menu, choose <strong>Team</strong>.</li>
<li>Click on <strong>Connect to the repository</strong>.</li>
<li>In the Create a new connection window, enter the URL, username, and password in the appropriate fields.</li>
<li>Click <strong><em>Next</em></strong> to connect to the remote SVN server.</li>
<li>From time to time, depending on your system and network security setup, you may be asked to confirm security credentials.</li>
<li>A popup displays a list of the existing Bonita repositories available on the SVN server.</li>
<li>Click on the button <strong><em>Create a new Bonita repository</em></strong>.</li>
<li>In the window, Repository name, give the repository a name e.g &quot;my_new_repository&quot;.</li>
<li>Click on <strong><em>OK</em></strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>The new repository is created locally and copied remotely to the SVN server. You can configure synchronization for this new shared repository.</p>
<h3>Connect to a shared repository</h3>
<p>To connect to a shared repository, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>In the <strong>Repository</strong> menu, choose <strong>Team</strong>.</li>
<li>Click on <strong>Connect to the repository</strong>.</li>
<li>In the Create a new connection window, enter the URL, username, and password in the appropriate fields.</li>
<li>Click on <strong><em>Next</em></strong> to connect to the remote SVN server.</li>
<li>From time to time, depending on your system and network security setup, you may be asked to confirm security credentials.</li>
<li>A popup displays a list of the existing Bonita repositories available on the SVN server.</li>
<li>Select the name of the repository, and click <strong><em>Connect</em></strong>.</li>
<li>A message is displayed, showing that you are connected to the shared repository. You can see the name of repository at the top left, in the title bar.</li>
<li>Click on <strong><em>OK</em></strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>The first time you connect to a repository, you might get a security warning.<br>
Configure security for the connection according to your organization's security policy.</p>
<h3>Change repository</h3>
<p>Before you change to a different repository, make sure you have saved your work.</p>
<p>To change repository, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>In the <strong>Repository</strong> menu, choose <strong>Change the repository</strong>.</li>
<li>A list of the available repositories is displayed. These are the local and shared repositories in your current workspace.</li>
<li>Select the repository to switch to, and click <strong><em>OK</em></strong>.</li>
<li>A confirmation message is displayed when you are working in the new location.
You can see the name of repository at the top left, in the title bar.</li>
</ol>
<p>If the list does not contain the name of the repository you want to use, check that you are using the correct workspace, and if necessary, switch workspace.</p>
<h3>Synchronize a shared repository</h3>
<p>Synchronizing a shared repository means merging the changes you have made in your local copy into the central repository on the server, and updating your local copy with the result.<br>
There are three modes for synchronizing:</p>
<ul>
<li>Recommended: Use manual synchronization for all repositories: With this mode, no automatic synchronization is done in either direction. This is the default behavior.
You launch synchronization manually, by going to the <strong>Repository</strong> menu, choosing <strong>Team</strong> then <strong>Commit artifacts</strong>. There is also a keyboard shortcut: <strong><em>Ctrl+Alt+C</em></strong>.</li>
<li>Use automatic synchronization for all repositories: With this mode, every time you make a change, it is saved in both your local copy and the central repository.
Changes made to the central repository are sent immediately to your local copy.<br>
You can only use this mode if you have a continuous network connection to the system hosting the SVN server. There is a significant network performance cost for using automatic synchronization. This option is not recommended.</li>
<li>Define synchronization mode repository by repository: With this mode, you define whether synchronization is manual or automatic for each repository.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Manage locks on shared resources</h3>
<p>This information applies to artifacts created in Bonita Studio but not those created in the UI Designer.</p>
<p>Bonita Studio automatically locks an artifact (process or shared resource) when you open it for editing. You can also lock an artifact manually.<br>
If you try to open an artifact that is locked by another user, a popup tells you that the artifact is logged and gives the SVN username of the person who owns the lock.<br>
You can choose to open the artifact in read-only mode, which means you cannot make any changes.<br>
It is also possible to unlock a locked artifact and lock it yourself, but this is not generally recommended except as a last resort if the owner of the lock cannot be contacted to release the lock.</p>
<p>You can choose to open an artifact in read-only mode, even if it is not locked by another user. If an artifact you are viewing in read-only mode is locked, there is a lock icon in the name tab at the top of the whiteboard.</p>
<p>To manually lock or unlock an artifact:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to the <strong>Repository</strong> menu, and choose <strong>Team</strong>, then <strong>Manage locks</strong>.</li>
<li>A popup displays the list of artifacts.</li>
<li>Select the artifact to lock or unlock, and then click the <strong><em>Lock</em></strong> or <strong><em>Unlock</em></strong> button.</li>
<li>Click <strong><em>OK</em></strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>To check the lock status of an artifact, go to the <strong>Diagram</strong> menu and choose <strong>Open</strong>, or click <strong><em>Open</em></strong> in the coolbar.<br>
In the popup, artifacts that you have locked are marked with a green padlock, and artifacts that another user has locked are marked with a red padlock and the user's SVN username.<br>
From the popup, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open a process that you have locked (marked with a green padlock) or that is not locked (no padlock).</li>
<li>Open a process in read-only mode. You can do this for any process, but it is most useful for a process that is locked by another user (red padlock).</li>
<li>Open a locked process (red padlock). You can open a locked process in read-only mode. You cannot open a locked process read-write.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Avoiding conflicts</h3>
<p>A conflict occurs when two or more users update the same process in a repository and the updates are not compatible.<br>
If you are using a shared repository, Bonita Studio automatically locks a Studio artifact when a user opens it for edit. (Note: UI Designer artifacts are not locked.)<br>
This means that only one user at a time can update the artifact, avoiding the possibility of conflicts. The only risk of conflicts is if a user takes over a lock from another user who has not committed their changes.<br>
For this reason, you are not recommended to unlock artifacts that are locked by another user.</p>
<p>It is also good practise to commit your changes regularly, to keep your local working copy synchronized with the central repository.<br>
To commit your changes, go to the <strong>Repository</strong> menu, choose <strong>Team</strong>, and then choose <strong>Commit artifacts</strong>.<br>
When you commit your changes, you have the option to release the lock so that another user can edit the artifact. By default, your lock is maintained.<br>
If you want to release the lock, uncheck the <strong>Keep locks</strong> box in the Commit dialog.</p>
<h3>Versioning and history</h3>
<p>If you are using a shared repository, all modifications to an artifact are recorded by the SVN server.</p>
<p>To view the history for an artifact:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to the <strong>Repository</strong> menu and choose <strong>Team</strong>, then <strong>History</strong>.</li>
<li>In the history list popup, select the artifact in the left-hand column.</li>
<li>The revision history for the selected artifact is displayed in the right-hand column.
This shows all the changes that have been made, and the author of each change.</li>
</ol>
<p>To revert to an older version, click on that version in the revision history, then click on <strong><em>Revert to this version</em></strong> in the popup.<br>
The selected version will be restored.</p>
<h3>Restore points</h3>
<p>A restore point is a marker in a repository that you can use to restore your repository back to an earlier state.<br>
The difference between a restore point and a version in the revision history is that a restore point applies to the whole repository but a version applies to a single artifact.</p>
<p>To create a restore point:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to the <strong>Repository</strong> menu and choose <strong>Team</strong>, then <strong>Manage restore points</strong>.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Create a restore point</strong> then click <strong><em>Next</em></strong>.</li>
<li>Enter a description for the restore point, then click <strong><em>Create</em></strong>. The restore point is created.</li>
</ol>
<p>To restore an older point:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to the <strong>Repository</strong> menu and choose choose <strong>Team</strong>, then <strong>Manage restore points</strong>.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Restore to an older point</strong> then click <strong><em>Next</em></strong>.</li>
<li>Select the restore point you want to restore, then click <strong><em>Restore</em></strong>. The repository reverts to the restore point.</li>
</ol>
