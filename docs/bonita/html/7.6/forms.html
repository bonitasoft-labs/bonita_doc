<h1>Forms</h1>
<p>This page explains how to add a form resource to the Bonita Portal and make it available to users. Form resources are intended for use in applications.</p>
<p>Pages are <a href="?page=resource-management" ng-click="contentCtrl.goTo($event, 'resource-management')">exported. imported, modified, and deleted</a> as resources in the Portal.</p>
<p class="h2">Form definition</p>
<p>A form is a <a href="?page=pages" ng-click="contentCtrl.goTo($event, 'pages')">page</a> that belongs to a process. It could be a process instantiation form, a human task form, or an overview form. There are some extra things to consider when you are creating a form compared with an ordinary page, concerning how data is passed between the process instance and the form.</p>
<p>A <a href="?page=contracts-and-contexts" ng-click="contentCtrl.goTo($event, 'contracts-and-contexts')">context</a> is the set of data provided by the process instance or task instance to the form.
There is no context for a process instantiation form.</p>
<p>A <a href="?page=contracts-and-contexts" ng-click="contentCtrl.goTo($event, 'contracts-and-contexts')">contract</a> is the definition of that data that the form returns to the process instance. There is no contract for an overview form.</p>
<p>Three auto-generated forms are provided by default, for process instantiation, for human task execution, and for the case overview.</p>
<p>The process instantiation and step execution auto-generated forms are based on the relevant contract and they are a useful tool for testing and debugging your application.</p>
<p>The overview consists of three main sections:</p>
<ul>
<li>List of business data: it shows the content of the business variables used by the case.</li>
<li>List of documents: it shows the content of each document used by the case.</li>
<li>Timeline: it shows in chronological order information about all the actions that have been performed in the selected case.</li>
</ul>
<p>To learn how to manage the link between process and forms, go to the <a href="?page=live-update" ng-click="contentCtrl.goTo($event, 'live-update')">live update</a> page.</p>
<h3>Application Theme access</h3>
<p>If your forms is viewed in an application, you will have access facilities for <a href="?page=applications" ng-click="contentCtrl.goTo($event, 'applications')">the application theme</a>.</p>
<p>The <code>Theme.css</code> is directly accessible by adding the following link in <code>index.html</code>: <code>&lt;link href=&quot;../theme/theme.css&quot; rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; /&gt;</code>
This link is already inserted in the forms you design with the UI Designer.</p>
<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
<p>The <code>app</code> URL parameter is used to retrieve the current application related Theme.<br>
The living application layout inject this <code>app</code> URL parameter in the targeted page/form URL, and the value is the application token.<br>
If you create your own navigation link, you will need to include this <code>app</code> URL parameter in the forged form URL, in order to be able to benefit from the application theme.</p>
</div>
<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
<p>In the portal, the link <code>../theme/theme.css</code> will point the file <code>theme.css</code> from the portal theme. This portal forms theme is empty, and customizable to fit to the current portal theme.</p>
