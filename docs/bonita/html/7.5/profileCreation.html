<h1>Profile Editor</h1>
<h2>Definition</h2>
<p>Basically, a <strong>profile</strong> is an XML file. It contains the profile name, a description, the mapping with the organization (which users / groups / roles / memberships have this profile) and the Bonita Portal menu entries (menus accessible to a user logged in the portal with this profile).<br>
A profile must be imported onto the portal, in the <strong>Profiles</strong> tab, to enable the profile (you need to connect with the <strong>Administrator</strong> profile to do it).<br>
Since Bonita 7.6.0, Bonita Studio offers this feature, for better packaging and deployment.
For development purposes, the Studio can <strong>deploy</strong> profiles onto the portal for you (<em>only for Performance and Efficiency editions</em>).</p>
<p>Profiles are packaged in <strong>files of profiles</strong>.<br>
A <strong>file of profiles</strong> is an XML file containing one or more profiles.</p>
<pre><code class="language-xml">&lt;!-- file of profiles --&gt;
&lt;profiles&gt;
	&lt;profile&gt;
		&lt;!--  First Profile --&gt;
	&lt;/profile&gt;
	&lt;profile&gt;
		&lt;!--  Second Profile --&gt;
	&lt;/profile&gt;
&lt;/profiles&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>However, profiles in a given file of profiles are totally <strong>independent</strong>.<br>
The purpose of grouping profiles in one file is to manage together profiles related to a same business application.<br>
For example, if you want to create a leave management application for four kind of users (Employees, Managers, Human Resources officers, and Administrators) then you will have to create four applications and four profiles, and to bind each profile to the related application. As for the four applications, the four profiles should be managed together, and so grouped in the same file of profile.
Files of profiles are also handy to be used in different environments: you can create different files, with the same profiles, but each profile is mapped to different entities of the organization depending on the target environment.
Therefore, you could have a &quot;profiles_dev.xml&quot;, a &quot;profiles_UAT.xml&quot;, and a &quot;profiles_prof.xml&quot; files of profiles.</p>
<p>There is a special file of profiles for default profiles: <code>default_profiles.xml</code><br>
This file can only contain default profiles and cannot be renamed or deleted.
Only the mapping between default profiles and entities of the organization can be edited.</p>
<p>Only Performance and Efficiency editions can create new file of profiles, in order to create custom profiles.</p>
<h2>Create and build a profile</h2>
<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
<p><strong>Note:</strong> All Bonita subscription editions come with an .xml editor for this feature. Only Performance and Efficiency editions also come with a graphical UI.</p>
</div>
<p>From Bonita Studio, click on <strong>Organization</strong> -&gt; <strong>Profile</strong> -&gt; <strong>New...</strong><br>
It will create an empty file of profiles with a default name and open an editor. You can <strong>rename</strong> this file from the graphical UI or from the menu <strong>Open</strong>.</p>
<p>The profile graphical UI provided is bound to the xml source, so you can use it to build your profile without writing xml.<br>
You can switch from the graphical UI to the xml source at any moment, using the tabs <em>Editor</em> and <em>Source</em> at the bottom of the editor.<br>
A toolbar is embedded to the editor, use it to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Add</strong> a profile to this file of profiles: you can add a new profile or duplicate an existing one from your current repository</li>
<li><strong>Save</strong> this file of profiles <strong>As</strong> an other file of profiles (useful to duplicate the whole file)</li>
<li><strong>Deploy</strong> this file of profiles (i.e all the profiles in this file)
⚠  For <em>development</em> purposes, it also deploys their referenced pages used as portal menu entries, but if those resources use REST API Extensions, you have to deploy those manually. In <em>production</em> environment, you still need to import pages, and REST API Extensions manually <strong>before</strong> to import the file of profiles.</li>
<li><strong>Rename</strong> this file of profiles</li>
<li><strong>Export</strong> this file of profiles (download the .xml)</li>
<li><strong>Delete</strong> this file of profiles from your current workspace</li>
<li><strong>Manage</strong> the Organization: add users / groups / roles to the organization in order to map them to this profile</li>
<li><strong>Restore</strong> the default file of profiles to its initial state (<em>only available for the file</em> <code>default_profile.xml</code>)</li>
</ul>
<p>Using the graphical editor, you can set all the parameters of your profile.</p>
<p>The <strong>profile name</strong> has to be unique in a given file of profiles, else it will lead to conflicts when you will try to deploy the file of profiles.<br>
You can duplicate a profile name in different files, but remember that you can only have one instance of a given profile in production.</p>
<p>In the mapping section you can map Users / Groups / Roles / Memberships to your profile. You have to map your profile with elements of the active organization.<br>
⚠  Nodes in the group tree are <strong>independent</strong> ⚠  It means that mapping <code>/acme</code> to your profile won't map <code>/acme/hr</code> to it. Each node has to be mapped individually to be taken into account. However, you can easily add a whole part of your organization, using the <em>add subtree</em> button:  select a node in the tree, and then click on <em>add subtree</em>.</p>
<p>The portal menu entries can be edited for custom profiles.<br>
Pages proposed are those provided by default in Bonita Portal and those created with the UI Designer. You can reference a custom page only if it is imported to the portal, and you will have to write its exact identifier.</p>
<p>The Applications section provides a quick access to the applications mapped to this profile.<br>
To map a new application to this profile, you have to open the application and then choose this profile in the profile field of the <a href="?page=applicationCreation" ng-click="contentCtrl.goTo($event, 'applicationCreation')">application descriptor editor</a></p>
