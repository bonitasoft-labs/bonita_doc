<h1>BDM access control - documentation</h1>
<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
<p><strong>Note:</strong> for Performance and Efficiency editions only.</p>
</div>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Currently, in Bonita, defining access control on a business object (BO) means defining which attributes of this business object a given user is allowed to access through REST API.<br>
If access controls are defined on the BDM, when a user calls a BDM API to retrieve some objects, the response will only contain the attributes this user is allowed to see.</p>
<h2>Use of profiles</h2>
<p>Most of the time, the access logic applies to several users, based on there roles/groups in the organization. This is why access control rules are bound with profiles.<br>
A <a href="?page=profiles-overview" ng-click="contentCtrl.goTo($event, 'profiles-overview')">profile</a> is basically a mapping with the organization. Granting access to some attributes of a business object to a given profile means granting access to all users mapped to this profile.<br>
The idea is to create profiles accordingly to your logic, and to grant access to those profiles.</p>
<h2>Define BDM access control</h2>
<p>To define access control on your BDM, you have to use the Access Control Editor embedded in Bonita Studio. You can open it using the menu: <em>Development</em> &gt; <em>Business Data Model</em> &gt; <em>BDM access control</em> &gt; <em>Define</em></p>
<p>Defining access control on a business object means defining a set of <strong>access rules</strong> on this object.<br>
A rule is made of the following elements:</p>
<ul>
<li>A name</li>
<li>A description</li>
<li>A list of attributes</li>
<li>A list of profiles</li>
</ul>
<p>Bonita 7.7 takes advantage of the capability introduced in Bonita 7.6 to define profiles in the Studio: an access control rule, defined at BO level, grants access to one or several profiles. We are making profiles an effective way to map people to Bonita items: living application or Bonita Portal access (since Bonita 5.0), BDM access control rules (starting in Bonita 7.7), actor mapping or more in the future.
If several rules grant access to the same profile, then this profile is allowed to access to the union of the attributes defined on those rules.</p>
<p>Business objects used in a <strong>composition relationship</strong> are handle differently. Access control rules must be defined at its parent level, because the only way to access a &quot;child&quot; is through its father. Since there is no access rule to define for a business object used in a composition relation, they are not displayed in the list of BO in the access control graphical editor, on the left, but they appear in the parent object list of attributes, in the details of the rule.
On the rules of the parent, you can define access control for the object in the attribute list, by defining which attributes of the object used in a composition relation are accessible.<br>
The <em>Invoice example</em> bellow gives more details on how to define access control for business objects used in composition relationship.</p>
<div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
<p><strong>Warning:</strong> To allow an easy migration to this new feature, and to keep our BDM API working, all objects are visible by everyone by default. But as soon as you define an accss control rule for one object, the BDM access control switches to <strong>a white list logic</strong>, meaning that you have to define access control <strong>for each and every business object of your BDM</strong>.<br>
Else some objects won't be accessible by anyone.<br>
The graphical editor helps you achieve this by adding a warning icon close to business objects that have no access rule defined.</p>
</div>
<p>For development purposes, the Studio can <strong>deploy</strong> access control on the portal for you. To install it in production, you have to export your access control file from the Studio (using the shortcut in the editor) and install it from the portal, using <a href="?page=bdm-management-in-bonita-bpm-portal" ng-click="contentCtrl.goTo($event, 'bdm-management-in-bonita-bpm-portal')">those instructions</a>.</p>
<h2>Example of use-cases to implement</h2>
<h3>I - Human resources novice</h3>
<p><strong>Business use case:</strong> In a company, there are two kinds of Human Resources employee: The experimented ones and the novice ones. Human Resources employees have to review the company's employees' leave requests. Leave requests include a medical comment if the cause of the leave is illness. So the access rule is <em>A novice HR employee should not be able to access the medical comment of any leave requests.</em></p>
<p><strong>Technical use case:</strong> Grant access to some attributes of a business object depending on the profiles of the requester.</p>
<p><strong>1. BDM definition</strong></p>
<p>First, define a <em>LeaveRequest</em> business object, with the following attributes:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Name</th>
<th>Type</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>employee</td>
<td>STRING</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>departureDate</td>
<td>DATE ONLY</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>duration</td>
<td>INTEGER</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>medicalComment</td>
<td>STRING</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>managerComment</td>
<td>STRING</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p><strong>2. Organization and Profiles definition</strong></p>
<p>In your organization, create a group 'Human Resources' and two roles: 'Trainee' &amp; 'Manager'.<br>
Create some users with the membership 'Trainee of Human Resources' and some others with the membership 'Manager of Human Resources'.</p>
<p>Define two custom profiles using the <a href="?page=profileCreation" ng-click="contentCtrl.goTo($event, 'profileCreation')">profile editor</a> in the Studio:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Novice HR</strong>, mapped with the membership 'Trainee of Human Resources'</li>
<li><strong>Experimented HR</strong>, mapped with the membership 'Manager of Human Resources'</li>
</ul>
<p>Deploy those profiles.</p>
<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Part 3. and 4. are not directly related to access control definition, it is just a convenient way to observe its results.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>3. Create a process and generate some data</strong></p>
<p>Create a new diagram, with only a start event and an end event.<br>
On the pool, add a business variable of type <em>LeaveRequest</em>, generate a contract from this data, and generate an instantiation form from this contract.<br>
Run this process a couple of times to generate LeaveRequest data.</p>
<p><strong>4. Create a living application to display data</strong></p>
<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
<p><strong>Note:</strong> In this tutorial, we create a basic living application to observe the results of our access rules. You can also directly call the API and check the response. Here is the API to call: <em>../API/bdm/businessData/com.company.model.LeaveRequest?q=find&amp;p=0&amp;c=10</em></p>
</div>
<p>In the UI Designer, create an application page (<em>displayLeaveRequest</em>):</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Create a new variable</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Name</strong> : leaveRequests</li>
<li><strong>Type</strong> : External API</li>
<li><strong>API URL</strong> :  ../API/bdm/businessData/com.company.model.LeaveRequest?q=find&amp;p=0&amp;c=10</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add a title to your page (<em>Leave requests</em>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add a container under the title</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Collection</strong>: leaveRequests</li>
<li><strong>CSS classes</strong>: alert alert-info</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Inside this container, for each of the following attributes of your Business Object <em>(employee - departureDate - duration - medicalComment - managerComment)</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add an input with the following configuration <em>( [current attribute name] should be replaced by employee or departureDate or duration or medicalComment or managerComment )</em>
<ul>
<li><strong>Label</strong> : <em>[current attribute name]</em></li>
<li><strong>Value</strong> : <em>$item.[current attribute name]</em></li>
<li><strong>Read-only</strong>: <em>true</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Create a new application descriptor using the <a href="?page=applicationCreation" ng-click="contentCtrl.goTo($event, 'applicationCreation')">application editor</a> in the Studio:</p>
<ul>
<li>Set the application token: leaveRequest</li>
<li>Set the Application Profile: User (ensure that the users mapped with the two profiles created in 2. are also mapped with the profile User)</li>
<li>Add an orphan page:
<ul>
<li><strong>Application Page</strong>: <em>custompage_displayLeaveRequest</em></li>
<li><strong>Token</strong>:  <em>displayLeaveRequest</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Set the Home page token: <em>displayLeaveRequest</em></li>
<li>Deploy</li>
</ul>
<p>Ensure that the living application works fine, and that all attributes are displayed at the moment.</p>
<p><strong>5. Define access control for your Business Object LeaveRequest</strong></p>
<p>We want to ensure that only experimented members of HR can access the attribute <em>medicalComment</em> of a leave request. A novice member of HR should not see this attribute.<br>
To do so, define two rules for our <em>LeaveRequest</em>:</p>
<p>The first rule is the rule for the novices members of HR:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rule name</strong>: <em>Novice HR Access</em></li>
<li><strong>Rule description</strong>: <em>A novice member of HR should not see the medical comment of a leave request</em></li>
<li><strong>Attributes checked</strong>:  <em>[employee, departureDate, duration, managerComment]</em></li>
<li><strong>Profiles checked</strong>: <em>[Novice HR]</em></li>
</ul>
<p>The second rule is the rule for the experimented members of HR:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rule name</strong>: <em>Experimented HR Access</em></li>
<li><strong>Rule description</strong>: <em>An experimented member of HR should see all the attributes of a leave request</em></li>
<li><strong>Attributes checked</strong>:  <em>[employee, departureDate, duration, medicalComment, managerComment]</em></li>
<li><strong>Profiles checked</strong>: <em>[Experimented HR]</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Deploy your access control file.</p>
<p><strong>6. Access control validation</strong></p>
<p>Access to your previous data is now controlled by the BDM Access Control file you just deployed. A novice member of HR can't see the attribute <em>medicalComment</em> on a LeaveRequest anymore.<br>
Connect onto the portal as a user with the profile <em>Novice HR</em>. Go to your application: the medical comment is always empty.<br>
Connect now as a user with the profile <em>Experimented HR</em>. On your application, the medical comments is displayed.</p>
<h3>II - Invoice</h3>
<p><strong>Business use case:</strong> A company has to handle invoices. An invoice references an order and a customer.<br>
An employee in charge of the preparation of the order shall access to the order but not to the customer of an invoice.<br>
An order is represented by several invoice line. An invoice line is made of a product and a quantity. A product is defined by a name and a price. An employee in charge of the preparation of the order is allowed to access the product name and the quantity but not the price of a product.<br>
A sales representative is allowed to access both the customer and the order of an invoice.<br>
A customer is represented by a name, an email and an address. A sells shall access to the name and the email of the customer, but not to its address.</p>
<p><strong>Technical use case:</strong> Grant access to some complex attributes (with composition or aggregation relations) of a business object depending on the profiles of the requester. The access control for the business object with an aggregation / composition relation has to be defined too.</p>
<p><strong>1. BDM definition</strong></p>
<p>Define a <em>Customer</em> business object, with the following attributes:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Name</th>
<th>Type</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>name</td>
<td>STRING</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>email</td>
<td>STRING</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>address</td>
<td>STRING</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Define a <em>Product</em> business object, with the following attributes:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Name</th>
<th>Type</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>name</td>
<td>STRING</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>price</td>
<td>INTEGER</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Define a <em>InvoiceLine</em> business object, with the following attributes:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Name</th>
<th>Type</th>
<th>Relation</th>
<th>Eager</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>product</td>
<td>Product</td>
<td>Composition</td>
<td>true</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>quantity</td>
<td>INTEGER</td>
<td></td>
<td></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Define a <em>Invoice</em> business object, with the following attributes:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Name</th>
<th>Type</th>
<th>Multiple</th>
<th>Relation</th>
<th>Eager</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>customer</td>
<td>Customer</td>
<td>false</td>
<td>Aggregation</td>
<td>true</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>fullOrder</td>
<td>InvoiceLine</td>
<td>yes</td>
<td>Composition</td>
<td>true</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>orderDate</td>
<td>DATE ONLY</td>
<td>false</td>
<td></td>
<td></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p><strong>2. Organization and Profiles definition</strong></p>
<p>In your organization create two groups, 'Sales' and 'Order picker', and a role 'Member'.
Create some users with the membership 'Member of Sales' and some with the memberships 'Member of Order picker'.<br>
Those users will represent the sales and the employees in charge of the preparation of the orders.</p>
<p>Define two custom profiles using the <a href="?page=profileCreation" ng-click="contentCtrl.goTo($event, 'profileCreation')">profile editor</a> in the Studio:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sales</strong>, mapped with the group 'Sales'</li>
<li><strong>Order picker</strong>, mapped with the group 'Order picker'</li>
</ul>
<p>Deploy those profiles.</p>
<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Part 3. and 4. are not directly related to access control definition, it is just a convenient way to observe its results.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>3. Create a process and generate some data</strong></p>
<p>The attribute <em>customer</em> has an aggregation relation type, so we first need to create a process to generate customers.</p>
<p>Create a new diagram, with only a start event and an end event.<br>
On the pool, add a business variable of type <em>Customer</em>, generate a contract from this data, and generate an instantiation form from this contract.<br>
Run this process a couple of times to generate customers.</p>
<p>Then, we are going to create a process to generate invoices. The instantiation form will have to retrieve existing customers, so there is some work to do on the UID for this process.</p>
<p>Create a new diagram, with only a start event and an end event.<br>
On the pool, add a business variable of type <em>Invoice</em>, generate a contract from this data, and generate an instantiation form from this contract.<br>
Int he UI Designer, create a new variable which will retrieve all the existing customers:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>name:</strong> customers</li>
<li><strong>type:</strong> External API</li>
<li><strong>URL:</strong> 	../API/bdm/businessData/com.company.model.Customer?q=find&amp;p=0&amp;c=10</li>
</ul>
<p>Remove all the existing input for the customer (persistence ID, name, email, address).<br>
Add a select widget:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Label:</strong> Customer</li>
<li><strong>Available values:</strong> customers (click on fx and it should be proposed)</li>
<li><strong>Displayed key:</strong> name</li>
<li><strong>Value:</strong> formInput.invoiceInput.customer</li>
</ul>
<p>You should now have a combo box which contains all the existing customers in the instantiation form of an invoice.</p>
<p>Run this process a couple of times to generate invoices.</p>
<p><strong>4. Create a living application to display data</strong></p>
<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
<p><strong>Note:</strong> In this tutorial, we create a basic living application to observe the results of our access rules. You can also directly call the API and check the response. Here is the API to call: <em>../API/bdm/businessData/com.company.model.Invoice?q=find&amp;p=0&amp;c=10</em></p>
</div>
<p>In the UI Designer, create an application page (<em>displayInvoices</em>):</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Create a new variable</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Name</strong> : invoices</li>
<li><strong>Type</strong> : External API</li>
<li><strong>API URL</strong> :  	../API/bdm/businessData/com.company.model.Invoice?q=find&amp;p=0&amp;c=10</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add a title to your page (<em>Invoices</em>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add a container under the title</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Collection</strong>: invoices</li>
<li><strong>CSS classes</strong>: well</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Inside this container:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add a title (Text = An invoice)</li>
<li>Add an input (<strong>Label:</strong> Order date, <strong>Value:</strong> $item.orderDate)</li>
<li>Add a container (<strong>hidden:</strong> <code>$item.customer == null || $item.customer == undefined</code>)
<ul>
<li>A title (Text: Customer)</li>
<li>An input ( <strong>Label:</strong> Name, <strong>Value:</strong> $item.customer.name)</li>
<li>An input ( <strong>Label:</strong> Email, <strong>Value:</strong> $item.customer.email)</li>
<li>An input ( <strong>Label:</strong> Address, <strong>Value:</strong> $item.customer.address, <strong>hidden:</strong> <code>$item.customer.address == null || $item.customer.address == undefined</code>)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Add a container, containing:
<ul>
<li>A title (Text: Order)</li>
<li>A container (<strong>Collection:</strong> $item.fullOrder)</li>
<li>Inside this container:
<ul>
<li>Add an input(<strong>Label:</strong> Product, <strong>Value:</strong> $item.product.name)</li>
<li>Add an input(<strong>Label:</strong> Price, <strong>Value:</strong> $item.product.price, <strong>hidden:</strong> <code>$item.product.price == null || $item.product.price == undefined</code>)</li>
<li>Add an input(<strong>Label:</strong> Quantity, <strong>Value:</strong> $item.quantity)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Create a new application descriptor using the <a href="?page=applicationCreation" ng-click="contentCtrl.goTo($event, 'applicationCreation')">application editor</a> in the Studio:</p>
<ul>
<li>Set the application token: invoice</li>
<li>Set the Application Profile: User (ensure that the users mapped with the two profiles created in 2. are also mapped with the profile User)</li>
<li>Add an orphan page:
<ul>
<li><strong>Application Page</strong>: <em>custompage_displayInvoices</em></li>
<li><strong>Token</strong>:  <em>invoices</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Set the Home page token: <em>invoices</em></li>
<li>Deploy</li>
</ul>
<p>Ensure that the living application works fine, and that all attributes are displayed at the moment.</p>
<p><strong>5. Define access control for your Business Object Invoice</strong></p>
<p>We first want to ensure that an order picker can access to the order and the date of an invoice. So, on the Object Invoice, we create a first rule:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rule name</strong>: <em>Invoice order picker access</em></li>
<li><strong>Rule description</strong>: <em>The order picker shall access to the order date and to the order, but not to the customer. He shall only access to the product reference and the quantity of the order.</em></li>
<li><strong>Attributes checked</strong>: <em>[ fullOrder, product, name, quantity, orderDate ]</em></li>
<li><strong>Profiles checked</strong>: <em>[Order picker]</em></li>
</ul>
<p>We want to ensure that on the order, so on each <em>InvoiceLine</em>, an order picker can only access to the product and the quantity. Because The InvoiceLine is used with a composition relation, we have to grant this access on the rule of the parent, i.e on the rule <em>Order picker access</em>.<br>
On the attribute list of the rule <em>Order picker access</em>, open the subtree of the attribute <em>fullOrder</em> and check the following attributes:  <em>[product, quantity]</em>.<br>
Finally, we want to ensure that the order picker can only access to the name of the product. Product is also used with a composition relation, so like we did with the InvoiceLine, check the attribute <em>[name]</em> on the subtree of the attribute <em>product</em>.</p>
<p>Then, we want to ensure that a sales can access to the date, the order and the customer of an invoice.
We create a second rule:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rule name</strong>: <em>Invoice sales access</em></li>
<li><strong>Rule description</strong>: *The order picker shall access to the order date, to the complete order and to the customer.</li>
<li><strong>Attributes checked</strong>: <em>[ customer, fullOrder, product, name, price, quantity, orderDate ]</em></li>
<li><strong>Profiles checked</strong>: <em>[Sales]</em></li>
</ul>
<p>We want to ensure that a sales can only access to the name and the email of a customer.<br>
The customer is an business object <em>Customer</em> used with an aggregation relation type. So, because of the nature of the relation, the access control on the customer has to be defined on the business object customer.<br>
So, we create a new rule on the business object <em>Customer</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rule name</strong>: <em>Customer sales access</em></li>
<li><strong>Rule description</strong>: <em>The sales shall access to the name and the email of the customer</em>.</li>
<li><strong>Attributes checked</strong>: <em>[ email, name ]</em></li>
<li><strong>Profiles checked</strong>: <em>[Sales]</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Deploy your access control file.</p>
<p><strong>6. Access control validation</strong></p>
<p>Access to your previous data is now controlled by the BDM Access Control file you just deployed. An order picker can't see the customer and the price of a product anymore. A Sales can't see the address of a customer anymore.<br>
Connect onto the portal as a user with the profile <em>Order picker</em>. Go to your application: the customer data and the order price are always empty.
Connect now as a user with the profile <em>Sales</em>. On your application, the customer data are displayed except the address. The price of the product is now available.</p>
