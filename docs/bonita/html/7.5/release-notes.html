<h1>Release notes</h1>
<p>Bonita BPM 7.5 includes a set of new features related to Living Application development and deployment as well as UI personalization, in addition to important technology updates and bug fixes.</p>
<a id="living-application-development-and-deployment"/>
<h2>Living Application development and deployment</h2>
<h3>New wizard to import a process in the studio &amp; compare the artifacts</h3>
<p>Bonita BPM Studio provides a wizard when importing a .bos that displays the duplicate artifacts (forms, connectors, ...)  and asks for user actions, between keeping the existing artifact and overwriting with the newly imported artifact:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ease collaboration between teams who work with .bos exchange</li>
<li>Reduce drastically the risk of overwrite error during import of a .bos.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Industrialization of Living Application (in Studio)</h3>
<p>Bonita BPM Studio provides an editor to create the Living Application descriptor (metadata and navigation) that took place in Bonita BPM Portal (Administrator profile) in previous versions. This is the first step towards a full Application artifacts development into Bonita BPM Studio in future versions <code>(Efficiency, Performance edition)</code> :</p>
<ul>
<li>Create and edit application descriptors in Studio.</li>
<li>Construct application navigation from inside Studio based on existing artifacts.</li>
<li>Store the descriptor in a VCS.</li>
<li>Deploy on the local portal to preview the Living Application and export for your production environment.</li>
</ul>
<a id="ui-personalization"/> 
<h2>UI personalization</h2>
<h3>New management of date/time in BDM, contracts, and user interfaces</h3>
<p>New management of date and time used in Living Applications across multiple timezones. It now follows the philosophy of Java 8 date management:</p>
<ul>
<li>Benefit from Java 8 improvement of date/time management in order to better manage timezones in BDM, contracts, and UI (forms and pages). Covers the following use-cases:
<ul>
<li>input and display a birthdate (not time related).</li>
<li>define and display meeting date and time (displayed in user timezone).</li>
<li>define and display a flight arrival date and time (displayed the same anywhere on the globe).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Note: this update does not change the way dates are displayed on Bonita BPM Portal.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Link widget and preview improvement</h3>
<p>The Link widget as been improved in order to support more use-cases; it can now be tested in the preview window in most cases. Improvements are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Addition of a new property to pass additional query parameters when creating a link to a form or a page</li>
<li>Addition of a new property to pass the name of the target application (useful in the preview when you want to test a link to an application page or when you need to redirect to another application)</li>
<li>The URL of the preview can be edited to pass additional parameters in the query string in web browsers supporting it (currently, only Firefox)</li>
</ul>
<a id="technology-updates"/>
<h2>Technology updates</h2>
<h3>Full Java 8 support</h3>
<p>Bonita BPM is fully compatible with java 8 in production and development environment. It allows to write java 8 extension points (Connectors, Actor Filters, Custom Pages, ...). Java 8 syntax and specific APIs can now be fully used in all Bonita BPM <a href="?hash=stable_extension_points&amp;page=software-extensibility" ng-click="contentCtrl.goTo($event, 'software-extensibility', 'stable_extension_points')">extensions points</a>.
JRE or JDK 8+ is <em>required</em> to run. Bonita BPM 7.5.0+ cannot be operated on Java 7.</p>
<h3>Support of Microsoft Edge</h3>
<p>Bonita web tools and user interfaces are fully compatible with Microsoft Edge and IE 11 browsers (UI Designer editor, all artifacts generated by the UI Designer (Forms, Pages, ...), Bonita BPM Portal).</p>
<h3>Integration of SSO SAML 2.0</h3>
<p>Bonita BPM works with Single-Sign-On (SSO) solutions using SAML V2 protocol <code>(Teamwork, Efficiency, Performance edition)</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use standard authentication service</li>
<li>Connect to Bonita Living Applications with company credentials (per tenant configuration)</li>
<li>Common SAML 2.0 Identity providers: ADFS (MS Active Directory Federation Services), SalesForce, Open AM, Google Auth,...</li>
</ul>
<h3>Removed support</h3>
<h4>Oracle Weblogic application server</h4>
<p>Bonita BPM 7.5.0+ does not support Oracle Weblogic application server anymore.<br>
Refer to <a href="?page=hardware-and-software-requirements" ng-click="contentCtrl.goTo($event, 'hardware-and-software-requirements')">full software requirements</a> for more details on supported environments.</p>
<h4>Internet Explorer 9 and 10</h4>
<p>Bonita BPM 7.5.0+ does not support Internet Explorer 9 and 10 anymore.<br>
Refer to <a href="?page=hardware-and-software-requirements" ng-click="contentCtrl.goTo($event, 'hardware-and-software-requirements')">full software requirements</a> for more details on supported environments.</p>
<h3>Other dependency updates</h3>
<ul>
<li>hibernate is updated to 4.3.11, to support JPA 2.1 specification</li>
<li>httpclient is updated to httpclient 4.5.2</li>
<li>httpcore is updated to httpcore 4.4.4</li>
<li>spring is updated to spring 4.3.7</li>
</ul>
<h3>API removals</h3>
<ul>
<li>Engine APIs have been cleaned up from some deprecated methods:
<ul>
<li>ProcessAPI.addComment() - replacement method is <a href="http://documentation.bonitasoft.com/javadoc/api/7.5/org/bonitasoft/engine/api/ProcessRuntimeAPI.html#addProcessComment-long-java.lang.String-" target="_self">ProcessAPI.addProcessComment()</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Breaking changes in UI Designer</h2>
<h3>Ui-bootstrap.js library removed from runtime</h3>
<p>In our first design iteration, forms, pages and layouts designed with the UI Designer embedded
<a href="http://angular-ui.github.io/bootstrap/versioned-docs/0.13.4/">UI Bootstrap js, version 0.13.4</a> by default and silently,
even when not needed. We have removed it so you can use it only when you need it, and with the version you choose.</p>
<p>Before this change, custom widgets could be created based on angular-bootstrap v0.13.0 with no explicit addition of
angular-bootstrap as an asset and without declaring required modules.</p>
<p>This will not affect any artifact that has been created with the UI Designer and is currently deployed in Bonita BPM Platform.</p>
<p>In development though, if your custom widgets use angular-bootstrap, you need to add angular-bootstrap as an asset at widget level, and declare the appropriate required modules.</p>
<h4>Forms, pages, layouts CSS cleaned</h4>
<p>The default CSS file embedded in UI Designer artifacts (except custom widgets) has been cleaned. Indeed, some of this CSS
rules were overall not used and cluttered this file.</p>
<p>This will not affect any artifact that has been created with the UI Designer and is currently deployed in Bonita BPM Platform.</p>
<p>Nevertheless some unwanted style could appear when importing a custom layout based on the default layout of Bonita BPM prior to 7.5.0.
If you do so and observe that the layout menu does not fit the whole width of your page, you can bring back the default
style by adding the following lines in <code>layout.css</code> file.</p>
<pre><code class="language-css">.component .container {
     width: 100%;
 }
</code></pre>
<p>We recommand that you re-create your custom layout based on Bonita 7.5.0+ default layout.</p>
<h2>Limitations and known issues</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>MacOS Sierra (10.12)</strong>: <strong>Bonita BPM Studio</strong> installed using the <code>zip</code> package fails during launch. Bonita BPM can successfully be installed on <strong>MacOS Sierra</strong> using the <code>dmg</code> package</li>
<li><strong>MacOS</strong> environment: starting from <strong>MacOS El Capitan 10.11.4</strong> (March 2016), new security rules block the launch of <strong>Bonita BPM Studio</strong>. You must temporarily remove security on <code>App</code> launching in <em>System Preferencesâ†’Security &amp; Confidentiality</em>.</li>
<li><strong>living application</strong>: if you forget the trailing slash in the URL, the redirection to the valid URL will encode your query parameters twice. You may have to manage this in your custom pages, in case you parse the query parameters and they contain special characters.</li>
</ul>
