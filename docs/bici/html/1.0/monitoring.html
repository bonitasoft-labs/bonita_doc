<h1>Monitor cases</h1>
<p>The Operation managment living application contains pages to monitor cases given their time prediction.</p>
<h2>The UI</h2>
<p>The view is filtered by process and optionally its version.
It is composed by a pie chart that shows the ratio between cases late, predicted late and on time.
It also contains a list of cases that displays the success rate percentage and the time remaining before the target duration.
You can click on a particular case to display its overview.</p>
