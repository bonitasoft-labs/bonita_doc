<h1>Next steps</h1>
<p>Future versions of ICI module should focus on the following missing features.</p>
<h2>Business data in the algorithm</h2>
<p>In order to have more relevant predictions on process which duration are more correlated to the business data, ICI module should take in account some or all business data of these process.</p>
<h2>Several algorithms</h2>
<p>The first version handle only one kind of prediction algorithm. In some cases, it could be more relevant to have different kind of algorithm depending on the process. ICI module should let the user choose and configure algorithm by process.</p>
<h2>Predict case end flow</h2>
<p>Right now ICI module compute prediction about case duration. An other kind of predition it does could be what kind of state the case will finish in. The case could have a successful outcome when finishing on a specific path or an error outcome when finishing on an other path.</p>
